For her role, actress Garima Panta won Best Actress award at SAARC Film Festival held in Sri Lanka, 2014.[2][3][4] The film was selected as the Nepali entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, but was not nominated.[5]Sati custom is an ancient practice of burning a widow on her deceased husband's funeral pyre or burning her alive in his grave. According to Hindu Scriptures, the custom of Sati was a voluntary practice in which a woman voluntarily decides to end her life with her husband after his death. But later the practice was abused and women were forced to commit Sati or were even dragged against their wish and put into the burning pyres. Historical accounts show that several Royal and common women were burnt alive through this savage practice. In BS 1977 Ashad 25 (1920 AD), Chandra Shumsher J.B.R. officially abolished the Sati system from Nepal.</p></td>
